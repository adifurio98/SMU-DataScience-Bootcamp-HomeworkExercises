    "In the last data table, output 25 for scores by school type, we are able to see  a trend in the grades of the schools. The average grades across both math and reading is noticeably higher in the charter schools verus the district schools. As someone who worked as a teacher at a charter school, this trend makes sense to me seeing as I know the difference in the curriculum and testing styles of my local charter and public schools.\n",
    "In the second to last table, output 24 for scores by size, we are also able to see a noticeable trend - the bigger the school size gets, the lower the grade average and passing percentage gets. Again, this trend makes sense because in theory the more students you have, the higher the ratio of students to teacher and the less (in theory) individualized help the students can recieve. \n",
    "In our third to last data table, output 23 for scores by budget, the trend appears to trend opposite of expected - the higher the spending per student goes the lower their average scores and passing scores go. This leads me to wonder what the spending may be going towards, or if maybe the schools that have the higher budgets also have the higher student size where we saw the the trend for grades go down."
